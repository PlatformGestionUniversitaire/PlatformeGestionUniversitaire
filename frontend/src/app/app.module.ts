// This project uses Angular's standalone bootstrap (bootstrapApplication in src/main.ts).
// The original AppModule declared standalone components which causes ngtsc diagnostics.
// Keep this placeholder file to avoid disrupting editor tooling; it intentionally does nothing.

// If you prefer to remove this file completely, you can delete it â€” ensure your editor/TS server
// reloads to clear any cached diagnostics.
